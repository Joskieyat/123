Hello everyone, did you get caught up against a certain Beaming blaze from space in the competitive Premier CS2 (Beaming blaze from space)? This player has screenshots of himself playing hardball, and I have a recording of a match where the player is openly playing, most likely using software. This user has been playing for many years, his steam level exceeds 150 and he is a member of ESEA groups. The current rank is Global Elite.. Current cs2 Rating rank 30.977K The current user has a K/D rating of 2.46 and HTLV of 1.9 Continuous play from 10 to 20 matches per day, with only 1 account blocked by VAC, since February 28 of this year (when CS2 activated the account) only 6 matches have been lost with a win rate of 84%.. What kind of nonsense is this, someone tell me - I also found his acc, he played against INSIDE Murzofix streamers there are only headshots

here is the profile itself https://steamcommunity.com/id/8lazed/
Also statistics on csstats https://csstats.gg/player/76561198842652010

Has anyone played with it or else the demos have something strange going on?
